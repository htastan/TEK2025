## Introduction  

::: columns
::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
**Research Focus**

- This study examines Turkish art markets through two econometric lenses:
  - Liquidity dimension: 
    - What characteristics predict whether an artwork sells? How do sale probabilities differ by artist prominence?
  - Price dimension:
    - What explains auction prices?
    - How do price determinants differ by artist prominence?
    - Hedonic price index and return to art investments. 
- Data: Turkish paintings auction data, 1989-2020 
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
**Methods**

- Sale probability analysis:
  - Probit model of sale (1/0)
  - Predicts: Artwork characteristics → Sale probability
  - By segment: Prominent/Elite artists vs. the rest
- Price analysis:
  - Hedonic regression of log(Sale price)
  - Predicts: Artwork characteristics → Price levels
  - By segment: Prominent vs. non-prominent
  
- Do liquidity and price models yield different insights?
- How do segments differ in each dimension?

## Introduction

Overview of the literature

::: columns
::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
**Global**

- Early pessimistic view (1980s-1990s):
  - Low real returns, high volatility 
  - Art underperforms financial assets significantly
  - High transaction costs and illiquidity penalties
- More recently (2000-2010s): 
  - Positive real returns but Sharpe ratios lag equities
  - Valuable diversification benefit: low correlation with stocks/bonds
  - Heterogeneous returns across segments: Modern art outperforms contemporary; investment-grade outperforms speculative
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
**Studies on Turkish art markets**

- Literature largely focuses on western art markets, Limited academic work on emerging market art 
- Turkish literature growing. Current evidence suggests: 
  - Small positive real returns and diversification benefits (Atukeren and Seçkin (2006)
  - Turkish market integrated with international art markets (Atukeren and Seçkin (2012))
  - Underperformance versus domestic equities but outperformance versus global aggregates with feedback to the stock market (Demir et al. (2018)),
  - Partial hedge/safe‑haven behavior during crises (Öztürkkal and Togan-Eğrican (2020))

## Dataset Overview

::: columns
::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
**Source and contents**

-   Data is scraped from the www.lebriz.com which maintains comprehensive archive of art auctions.
-   Discontinued in 2023, but contains data spanning 1990s to 2020
-   We focus on paintings only (exclude sculpture, lithography, editions, etc.)
-   Transaction level data on auction items
-   Not repeat sales
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
**Variables**

-   Artist name, auction house, auction date
-   Artwork characteristics: dimensions (width and height), type of paintings (oil on canvas, watercolor on paper, oil on wood, acrylic on canvas, etc.), whether signed or not,
-   Opening prices (contains missing values)
-   Sale prices (in TL and USD) if sold (hammer price)
:::

## Artists 

- There is no established list of blue-chip artists. 
- Instead this study relies on a market-based reproducible metrics to determine elite/prominent artists
- This is to see if there is heterogeneity in the art auction markets based on artists
- Anonymous artworks and artists with less than $15$ items are excluded.
- The ranking is based on the following Prominence Score (PS): 
$$
PS_i = 0.3 \times \text{Norm}(\bar{P}_i) + 0.3 \times \text{Norm}(V_i) + 0.2 \times \text{Norm}(N_i) + 0.2 \times \text{Norm}(P_{\max,i})
$$
- $\bar{P}_i$: average sale price, 
- $V_i$: total market volume (cumulative sum of all sales)
- $N_i$: total number of transactions 
- $P_{\max,i}$: maximum sale price 
- $Norm(x)$ is the min-max normalization to (0,1) defined as
$$
\text{Norm}(x) = \frac{x - \min(x)}{\max(x) - \min(x)}
$$ 



## Prominent Artists 


- Top 100 artists are classified in the Elite/Prominent segment out of 486 unique artists.

| Segment | Artworks Offered | Sale Rate | Avg Price | Total Volume | Artists |
|---------|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|
| Non-Prominent | 57,496 | 58.6% | $4,203 | $141.7M | 388 |
| Prominent (Top 100) | 43,025 | 73.8% | $17,410 | $552.7M | 100 |
| **Total** | **100,521** | **65.3%** | **$10,323** | **$694.4M** | **488** |
: Sample composition and liquidity by artist segment (1989-2020)

* Includes Anonymous artists and those with lots<15 (classified as nonprominent).

* **Key Pattern:** The top 100 artists (20.5% of population) generate 79.6% of total market volume, with 4.1× higher average prices and 15.2 percentage points higher sale rates. This concentration motivates separate econometric analysis by segment.

* In the sales and hedonic price modeling we exclude Anonymous and nlots<15 groups. 


## Liquidity by Artist group

| Artist Group | N Offered | N Sold | N Unsold | Sale Rate |
|---------|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|
| Prominent | 43,020 | 31,748 | 11,272 | 73.8% |
| Non-Prominent | 40,450 | 24,766 | 15,684 | 61.2% |
| Anonymous | 3,181 | 1,637 | 1,544 | 51.5% |
| Other (nlots<15) | 13,856 | 7,312 | 6,544 | 52.8% |
| **Total** | **100,507** | **65,463** | **35,044** | **65.1%** |
: Sale rates by artist group (1989-2020)


- **Prominent artists** have the highest sale rate (73.8%)
- **Anonymous artworks** have the lowest (51.5%)
- **Non-prominent** but established artists fall in the middle (61.2%) indicating meaningful market depth. 
- **Artists with few items** also have low sale rates (52.8%) which may be a sign of limited marketing attention, weaker collector demand, and greater uncertainty about quality or attribution.
- Overall market sale rate: 65.1%

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
![](fig/sale_price_hist.png)
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
 

**Prominent Artists (Teal):**
- Peak: $5,000–$20,000
- Right-skewed distribution
- Higher median price
- Concentrated in mid-to-high range

**Non-Prominent (Orange):**
- Peak: $800–$2,000

## Model Formulation 

We estimate a probit model with fixed effects to predict sale probability:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{sold}_i = 1 | \mathbf{X}_i) &= \Phi(\mathbf{X}_i' \boldsymbol{\beta} + \alpha_{a(i)} + \alpha_{h(i)} + \alpha_{t(i)}) \\
\end{aligned}
$$
where:

- $\text{sold}_i$ is a binary indicator equal to 1 if artwork $i$ sold at auction, 0 otherwise
- $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the standard normal CDF (probit link function)
- $\mathbf{X}_i$ includes artwork characteristics:
  - $\text{signed}_i$: indicator for signed artwork; $\log(\text{size}_i)$:  log area in cm² (width*height);  $\log(\text{aspect}_i)$: log aspect ratio (width/height)
  - $\text{medium}_i$ — art medium (oil, watercolor, etc.), base group = oil
  - $\text{material}_i$ — art material (canvas, paper, etc.) base group = canvas
- $\alpha_{a(i)}$ — artist fixed effect 
- $\alpha_{h(i)}$ — auction house fixed effect (20+ sales) 
- $\alpha_{t(i)}$ — semi-annual time fixed effect
- Standard errors clustered at artist and time  



## Sale Model Probit Results {.smaller}

![](fig/probit_coef_plot.png)

::: notes
Key findings: - All coefficients have the same sign across all three models - log(Size) is consistently positive and significant - log(Opening Price) is consistently negative (U-shaped relationship confirms this) - Prominent artists benefit from a "Signed" premium (\~0.31 coefficient) - Canvas material has a positive effect on sale probability
:::


## Average Marginal Effects on Sale Probability

| Variable | All Artists | Prominent | Non-Prominent |
|----------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| Signature | +8.0pp*** | +10.7pp*** | +4.8pp*** |
| log(Size) | +6.6pp*** | +4.8pp*** | +9.0pp*** |
| log(Opening Price) | −10.0pp*** | −7.1pp*** | −13.6pp*** |
| log(Aspect Ratio) | −1.9pp** | −1.4pp | −2.3pp** |


1. **Signature matters most for prominent artists** (+10.7pp) but matters less for the rest (+4.8pp)

2. **Size matters most for non-prominent artists** (+9.0pp)  

3. **Opening price is the dominant penalty** — especially for non-prominent (−13.6pp per log increase)
   - A non-prominent work with 10% higher reserve loses 1.4pp in sale probability
   - Auctioneers must price aggressively for this segment

4. **Aspect ratio** — has a small but significant effect

5. **Medium, material effects**, while statistically significant, are economically modest. This suggests buyers prioritize the **artistic medium and the artist's reputation** far more than physical durability or presentation format.  



## Opening Price vs Sale Probability 


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="80%"}

![](fig/sale_opening_price1.png){width="70%"}
 
- Buyers discount heavily on non-prominent names; high reserves signal desperation or overvaluation
- At extreme prices, high reserves on prominent works signal confidence (attraction) 
 
:::

::: {.column width="20%"}

- Aggressive opening prices filter to serious collectors only; for non-prominent segment this shrinks the addressable market; for established names, it selects the most committed buyers
 
:::

::::

<!-- ## Sale model: summary  -->

<!-- - **Core drivers** of sale probability are signature status (+8–11pp), artwork scale (+5–9pp), and opening price strategy (−7 to −14pp). These factors dwarf all other considerations. -->

<!-- - **Medium effects**, while statistically significant, are economically modest. Drawing media (graphite, pastel) incur penalties of 4–8pp relative to oil painting, but this pales beside the 10pp opening price elasticity or the 6–9pp size effect. Acrylic performs equivalently to oil, suggesting **technique matters less than the painting vs. drawing dichotomy**—reflecting persistent market preference for painted works over drawings. -->

<!-- - **Material effects** are negligible (1–4pp penalties for paper, wood, hardboard vs. canvas). This suggests buyers prioritize the **artistic medium and the artist's reputation** far more than physical durability or presentation format. Canvas remains optimal but substrate choice is tertiary relative to technique choice. -->

<!-- - **Bottom line:** Success hinges on **who made it** (signature), **how big it is** (size), and **what price the auctioneer sets** (reserve). The mechanics of production—whether acrylic vs. oil, canvas vs. paper—matter but are secondary concerns. -->

# Hedonic Regression Model {background-image="img/osman-hamdi-bey-kaplumbaga-terbiyecisi.jpg" background-size="cover" background-opacity="0.4"}

## Methodology

An artwork's log auction price can be written as

$$
p_{it} = p_i + p_t + \varepsilon_{it}, 
$$

where $p_{it}$ is the log price of object $i$ at time $t$, $p_i$ captures the fixed (unobserved) quality of the object, $p_t$ is the period price index (common market movement), and $\varepsilon_{it}$ is an idiosyncratic shock.

Hedonic specification substitutes a parametric form for the fixed quality:
 
$$
p_{it} = \beta x_i + \sum_{t=1}^{T} \gamma_t D_t + \varepsilon_{it},
$$

- $x_i$: vector of observed attributes (signed dummy, size, aspect ratio, medium of art, material, artist fixed effects, auction house fixed effects), $D_t$ is period dummy (half-year). Hedonic Price Index is constructed by 
$$
\text{Index}_t = 100 \times \exp(\gamma_t - \gamma_{\text{base}}),
$$
where base period is 1989-H1. 

- hedonic models control for quality by observable characteristics $x$ (allowing use of all observations), while repeat‑sales treat $p_i$ as an object fixed effect (identified only for items sold more than once).

## Conclusion 


**This study provides comprehensive analysis of sale probability and hedonic price regressions for Turkish paintings (1989-2020), revealing:**

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Performance Reality**
- Art underperformed traditional assets across all metrics
- Quality stratification extreme: 5× Sharpe ratio difference
- Even prominent artists achieved only 3% real returns
- Failed as inflation hedge in high-inflation environment

**Market Mechanism**
- Sale probability dominated by signature (+8-11pp) and reserve pricing (-7 to -14pp)
- Extreme price sensitivity in non-prominent segment (-13.6pp per log increase)
- Two distinct markets with different buyer behaviors

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Diversification Potential**
- Cannot diversify within art (0.56-0.91 internal correlations)
- Modest benefit for equity portfolios (0.28 correlation with stocks)
- Unreliable safe haven (weak negative gold correlation, high volatility)

**Investment Verdict**
- Art = consumption good with modest financial upside
- Requires expert selectivity (prominent only)
- Small portfolio allocation (<5%) justified only for diversification
- Alternative assets (gold, stocks) superior on risk-adjusted basis

**Future work**
- Hedonic price indices are not truly stochastic
- Alternative Kalman-filter based methods may provide additional insights
- Dynamic relationship and causality analysis with macroeconomic and financial variables
- Extend sample beyond 2020

 **Antik A.S. dominates by volume but not transactions** — They capture ~30% of sales volume but only ~16% of transactions, indicating they handle higher-priced artworks.

- **Volume vs. Transaction concentration** — this graph shows high concentration (top 3 houses), while transactions (in the next slide) are more dispersed. High-value sales concentrate in fewer houses, but transaction volume spreads across more players.

- Beyaz leads by transaction count - They have the most transactions (~17%) but only ~13% of volume. This indicates they sell more items at lower average prices.

- **Market Structure** — Three auction houses (Antik A.S., Beyaz, Bali) account for ~50% of total volume but a smaller share of transaction count.
